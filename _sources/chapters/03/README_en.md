# Derivation of a Real-Variable Function #

In this chapter, we will introduce the derivation for real functions of a real variable and study their properties and some applications.

We divide it into six sections (plus a problem bulletin):

1. Definition of derivative and basic properties.
2. Newton-Raphson numerical method.
3. Successive derivatives.
4. Applications of derivation.
5. Convexity and concavity.
6. Taylorâ€™s theorem.
